# Secure Data Sharing in Cloud Environments: A Cryptography-Based Approach
In today’s technologically advanced culture, protecting personal information kept on cloud servers is critical. By creating a strong foundation for safe cloud data storage and access, our project addresses this pressing need. Transparency and accountability are maintained by using encryption algorithms, safe preservation practices, and strict permission procedures.Through a smooth integration with Azure cloud services, our solution enables content owners and users to safely store and retrieve material. Owners pick the files and set the keys before sending them to Azure to start the procedure. Crucially, owner and user credentials are kept in a MySQL database together with information including file names, MAC addresses, and AES-encrypted encryption keys.A key component of our system is the Data Provenance System, which precisely records every interaction
with the data that has been saved. Our solution uses an advanced information
traceability method that communicates with the MySQL database for users who
need access to these files.Users are asked for their preferred file name after granting authorization, which starts the authentication and verification procedure.Additionally, our system lets users personalize files, which simplifies collaborative editing. To ensure data integrity throughout the process, users must first get the owner’s authentication clearance before uploading updated files back to the cloud.Overall, our study addresses the core issues of secure data storage in the cloud while underscoring the crucial importance of data origination and access control in today’s digital landscape. By integrating advanced encryption techniques with stringent security measures, we offer a cost-effective solution for safeguarding personal information in cloud environments.
